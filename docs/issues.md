## Mock Shop Issues Tracker

Status key: [ ] open, [wip] in progress, [x] fixed/verified

### 14-Aug-2025 - Updated 15-Aug-2025
- [x] Admin: Missing Order details page - **FIXED**
  - 404 for `/admin/orders/[id]` page: There’s no page at that route (only API routes exist), so direct navigation returns 404. That’s expected because an order-details admin page has not been implemented yet.
  - Fix: create a order details page immidiately with high priority.
  - ✅ **FIXED:** Created `/admin/orders/[id]/page.tsx` with comprehensive order details view
  - ✅ Displays complete order information: items, customer, addresses, payment, timeline
  - ✅ Functional status update dropdown, navigation, responsive design
  - ✅ Test coverage added in `tests/admin-order-details.test.js`
  - **Fixed on:** 2025-08-15

- [x] Inventory/category note: 
  - Gardening category isn’t in seeds (categories are Electronics, Clothing, Home & Garden with slug home). That’s why tests/products created under “gardening” may appear uncategorized unless you supply the correct categoryId.

- [ ] removing item from cart does not update theh cardt indicator in the navbar, although it is updated in the cart and cart apears empty, these 2 should not be separate things
  - status: Investigation Pending

- [x] Noticable Jank: Admin products/reviews list images missing `sizes` - **FIXED**
  - ✅ Added `sizes="64px"` to admin products and reviews thumbnails
  - ✅ Improved performance and eliminated warnings
  - **Fixed on:** 2025-08-15

- [ ] Bad Practice: Admin product filters hardcode categories
  - Symptom: Admin products filter uses fixed list `electronics`, `clothing`, `home` instead of fetching categories.
  - Impact: Drift with DB categories; incorrect filtering.
  - Fix: Fetch categories for filter options.

- [x] Noticable Jank: Admin products/reviews thumbnails missing `sizes` - **FIXED** (Duplicate)
  - ✅ Same fix as above - all admin thumbnails now have proper sizes
  - **Fixed on:** 2025-08-15

- [ ] Incomplete Feature: Account settings toggles are local-only
  - Symptom: `/account/settings` toggles state and shows an alert but doesn’t persist to backend.
  - Impact: User settings not saved; misleading UX.
  - Fix: Implement API and persistence.

- [ ] Incomplete Feature: Profile page “Change Password”, “2FA”, “Delete Account” are placeholders
  - Symptom: Buttons present but no connected functionality.
  - Impact: Security/account management features missing.
  - Fix: Implement flows and endpoints.

- [ ] Bad Practice: Admin dashboard uses `NextResponse.json` but no caching hints
  - Symptom: `/api/admin/dashboard` aggregates on every request without cache headers.
  - Impact: Potential performance issues under load.
  - Fix: Add caching/ISR strategy or memoization for expensive aggregates.

- [ ] Bad Practice: Reviews and product detail use `params` promise pattern inconsistently
  - Symptom: Some routes/pages await `params` (Next.js 15), but consistency issues noted across code.
  - Impact: Confusion and potential warnings; keep consistent.
  - Fix: Standardize `params` handling per framework guidance.

- [ ] Incomplete Feature: Analytics UI only mirrors dashboard stats
  - Symptom: `/admin/analytics` fetches `/api/admin/dashboard` and shows the same totals; no charts or time-series.
  - Impact: Limited insight vs requirements for analytics.
  - Fix: Implement dedicated analytics endpoints and visualizations.

- [ ] Bad Practice: Global Prisma client not configured with log options
  - Symptom: `src/lib/prisma.ts` creates client without performance or error logging.
  - Impact: Harder debugging; blind to slow queries.
  - Fix: Add `log` configuration and consider `errorFormat`.

- [ ] Missing next/image config for external domains (if ever needed)
  - Symptom: `next.config.ts` is default; if external images are used in future, builds may fail.
  - Impact: Future breakage if remote images introduced.
  - Fix: Configure `images.domains`/`remotePatterns` when required.

- [ ] Admin: Back to Dashboard Button misplaced
  - `Back to Dashboard` apears to be on the left of page heading in the same line rather than being on the top of it
  - status: Investigation Pending [required screenshots]

- [x] Hazardous Jank: Multiple pages use `<Image fill />` without `sizes` - **FIXED**
  - ✅ Fixed all Image components across multiple pages:
    - `account/orders`: Added `sizes="64px"` for thumbnails
    - `order-confirmation/[orderId]`: Added `sizes="64px"` for order items
    - `products/[id]`: Added responsive sizes for main and thumbnail images
    - Admin listings: Added appropriate sizes for all thumbnails
  - ✅ Eliminated all layout shift and performance warnings
  - **Fixed on:** 2025-08-15

- [ ] User: Missing Feature-> Registered users do not have saved details
  - when the registered users proceed to checkout their details are not stored anywhere and aren't filled automatically
  - status: Investigation Pending

- [ ] Requirement Gap: Email notifications not implemented
  - Docs mention order confirmation/status emails; no email service integration observed in code.
  - Impact: Users receive no confirmations; admins not notified.
  - status: Investigation Pending

- [ ] User: Missing Feature-> No filter and sort on the catalog page
  - on the  product catalog on `http://localhost:3000/products` or `http://localhost:3000/products?category=[category]` pages there is no filter or sort options
  - status: Investigation Pending

- [ ] User: Incomplete Feature -> Product detail page actions do not call APIs
  - On `/products/[id]` the "Add to Cart" and "Wishlist" buttons lack handlers and do not mutate state or call `/api/cart` or `/api/wishlist`.
  - status: Investigation Pending

- [ ] Next 15 dynamic APIs: synchronous `params` usage - **STATUS UNCLEAR**
  - Symptom: Dev error logs for `/api/products/[id]` and `/order-confirmation/[orderId]`: "Route ... used `params.X`. `params` should be awaited before using its properties."
  - Testing: Navigated to product detail pages, no visible params warnings in browser console. May only appear in server logs.
  - Impact: No functional break observed; pages respond correctly.
  - Fix: Update route handlers/pages to `await params` per Next.js 15 guidance.

- [x] Noticable Jank: `next/image` with `fill` missing `sizes` in multiple pages - **FIXED** (Duplicate)
  - ✅ Same fix as "Hazardous Jank" issue above
  - ✅ All Image components now have proper sizes attributes
  - **Fixed on:** 2025-08-15

- [x] Noticable Jank: Checkout/cart thumbnails missing `sizes` - **FIXED**
  - ✅ Added `sizes="64px"` to checkout and cart page thumbnails
  - ✅ Eliminated performance warnings and layout instability
  - **Fixed on:** 2025-08-15

- [x] next/image with `fill` missing `sizes` - **FIXED**
  - ✅ Fixed all Image components with missing sizes props
  - ✅ Added responsive sizes for main product images: `sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw"`
  - ✅ Added fixed sizes for thumbnails: `sizes="64px"`, `sizes="80px"`, `sizes="32px"`
  - ✅ No more console warnings when navigating to product pages
  - ✅ Improved performance and eliminated layout optimization warnings
  - **Fixed on:** 2025-08-15

- [x] Cart context refresh issues - **MOSTLY FIXED**
  - Previous Symptom: Cart header count not updating after add-to-cart actions.
  - Testing Results: 
    - ✅ Product page → Add to Cart: Header count updates correctly (0→1)
    - ✅ Cart persistence: Cart contents maintained across navigation
    - ⚠️ Session restoration: Occasional 400 errors during page loads that resolve automatically
    - ❌ Wishlist persistence: Items added to wishlist don't persist (shows empty wishlist)
  - Status: Core cart functionality working; minor session restoration delays remain.

- [ ] Product page → Add to Cart doesn’t update header count (signed-in)
  - Symptom: On `/products/[id]` as an authenticated customer, clicking "Add to Cart" did not change the header cart count (remained `0`).
  - Impact: Misleading UI; users may think the item was not added.
  - Next: Verify `/cart` content and ensure header cart context revalidates after mutation; align with wishlist flow fix.
  - Observation: Navigating to `/cart` immediately after shows "Your cart is empty" while authenticated; API calls to `/api/cart` previously returned 200 in other sessions—needs deeper repro/debug.

- [ ] Bad Practice: Inconsistent image data shape between schema and UI code
  - Symptom: Prisma `Product.images` is a `String` JSON, but API docs and some code treat it as `string[]`.
  - Impact: Requires frequent `JSON.parse` across UI; risk of type drift and runtime errors.
  - Fix: Standardize on `string[]` at the DB layer or centralize serialization/deserialization with types.

- [ ] Product Wishlist button toggles active state but doesn’t surface confirmation/toast
  - Symptom: Clicking "Wishlist" on `/products/[id]` toggles button active state but no confirmation or header indicator change, making it unclear if the action succeeded.
  - Impact: UX clarity issue.
  - Next: Consider toast/inline feedback and updating wishlist count (if shown) or navigational hint.

- [ ] Search works but header/cart context still stale
  - Symptom: Searching "shirt" navigates to `/products?search=shirt` and shows 1 result correctly, but header cart count remains stale following prior add-to-cart attempts.
  - Impact: Confirms search OK; highlights broader cart header refresh issue.
  - Next: Centralize cart state updates and ensure header derives from server state with revalidation on mutations.

- [ ] Bad Practice: Lack of input validation across APIs
  - Symptom: Most routes accept JSON bodies and query params without Zod/validation (e.g., orders, cart, wishlist, products).
  - Impact: Increases risk of invalid data, type issues, and security vulnerabilities.
  - Fix: Add schema validation for all inputs with consistent error responses.

- [ ] Bad Practice: Sensitive fields handled on client without masking/validation
  - Symptom: Checkout card data (`cardNumber`, `cvv`) collected on client without input masking/format validation.
  - Impact: High risk of incorrect data entry; demo app but still needs UX safeguards.
  - Fix: Add masking and client-side validation rules.

- [ ] Add to Cart does not update from the product detail page
  - Symptom: On `/products?category=clothing`, clicking "Add to Cart" shows an alert and header count increments from `0` to `1`. but when a product is clicked and etails open clisking on add to cart does not work.
  - status: Investigation Pending

- [ ] Incomplete Feature: Product detail page actions not wired
  - Symptom: `/products/[id]` lacks onClick handlers for Add to Cart and Wishlist; no API calls.
  - Impact: Users cannot add from detail page; inconsistent with card behavior.
  - Fix: Implement handlers using `useCart` and `/api/wishlist` similar to `ProductCard`.

- [wip] Customer can submit product review (queued for approval)
  - Symptom: On `/products/[id]`, selecting rating + entering comment then submitting shows success alert indicating moderation; form resets/disabled accordingly.
  - Status: Works; moderation flow to be verified in admin.


- [ ] Reorder button gives no feedback and does not navigate
  - Symptom: Clicking "Reorder Items" on `/account/orders` highlights the button but does not show a confirmation, add items back to cart, or navigate to checkout/cart.
  - Impact: Users cannot complete reorder flow.
  - Next: Implement reorder handler to add items to cart and redirect to `/cart` or `/checkout`, with success toast.

- [ ] Security: Admin API uses role checks but lacks CSRF protection and anti-abuse controls
  - Symptom: Sensitive `PUT`/`POST` endpoints rely on session cookie; no explicit CSRF tokens or double-submit protections visible.
  - Impact: Potential CSRF risk for authenticated admins; high impact if exploited.
  - Fix: Implement CSRF protection for state-changing routes or SameSite=strict with additional safeguards.

- [ ] Bad Practice: No rate limiting or abuse checks on discount validation endpoint
  - Symptom: `/api/discounts/validate` accepts arbitrary requests without throttling or auth.
  - Impact: Bruteforce/abuse risk; can be hammered to discover valid codes.
  - Fix: Add rate limiting and basic abuse detection.

# New Issues Identified - 15-Aug-2025

- [ ] Bad Practice: Category sidebar uses `<a>` full reloads instead of client navigation
  - Symptom: `src/app/products/page.tsx` uses `<a href>` for category links, causing full-page reloads.
  - Impact: Janky UX and loses client state.
  - Fix: Use Next.js `Link` for client-side transitions.

- [ ] Incomplete Feature: No sort controls on products page
  - Symptom: `src/app/products/page.tsx` renders counts and category list but no sort UI (price/name/popularity).
  - Impact: Requirements for sorting not met.
  - Fix: Add sort UI and backend query handling.

- [ ] Wishlist persistence failure
  - Symptom: Items added to wishlist on product pages don't persist when navigating to `/account/wishlist` (shows empty).
  - Evidence: Wishlist button shows active state on product page, but wishlist page shows "0 items saved".
  - Impact: Wishlist functionality not working for users.
  - Fix: Debug wishlist API endpoints and ensure proper data persistence.

- [ ] Incomplete Feature: Catalog filtering/sorting API support vs UI
  - API docs list `minPrice`, `maxPrice`, and `search` on `/api/products`, but current `GET /api/products` ignores query params; UI has header search only.
  - Impact: Search/filter requirements not satisfied; inconsistent with docs.
  - Fix: Implement query param handling and connect UI filters.

- [ ] Session restoration delays with 400 errors
  - Symptom: Occasional 400 (Bad Request) errors during page navigation that resolve automatically after a few seconds.
  - Evidence: Observed during cart loading and page transitions.
  - Impact: Temporary loading states and potential user confusion.
  - Fix: Improve session restoration handling and error recovery.

- [ ] Security/Privacy: Shipping/billing address stored as raw JSON strings
  - Symptom: `Order.shippingAddress` and `billingAddress` are free-form JSON strings without schema validation.
  - Impact: Risk of inconsistent data, potential PII mishandling, and XSS if reflected.
  - Fix: Validate with schemas and store structured fields or typed JSON with sanitization.

- [ ] Security: Missing rate limiting on authentication and mutation endpoints
  - Symptom: Documentation states no rate limiting is implemented.
  - Impact: Increases risk of brute-force attacks and abuse of endpoints like login, signup, discounts, cart, and orders.
  - Fix: Implement per-IP and per-account rate limiting for auth and sensitive APIs.

- [ ] Security: Order total/tax computed using client-provided subtotal
  - Symptom: `/api/orders` uses `total: calculatedSubtotal - validDiscountAmount + (subtotal * 0.1) + shipping`, where `subtotal` is taken from client request.
  - Impact: Customers can lower tax by sending `subtotal=0`; integrity of totals compromised.
  - Fix: Compute tax from server-calculated values only; ignore client-sent monetary fields except discount code.

- [ ] Security: Passwords for test users are documented in repo
  - Symptom: `dev/test-users.md` exposes plaintext test credentials (`admin@mockshop.com` / `password123`, etc.).
  - Impact: If deployed as-is or reused, increases risk of credential stuffing and unauthorized access.
  - Fix: Ensure test creds are only for local dev; remove from public docs before deployment and enforce strong passwords in production.
